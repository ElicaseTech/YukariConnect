the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file
included with all distributions of the Covered Software.

## 5. Termination

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become

Contributor are reinstated: (a) provisionally, unless and until the
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants; and (b) on
an ongoing basis, if the Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-
claims, and cross-claims) alleging that any Covered Software infringes a
patent, then any rights granted to You by this License for that
Covered Software shall terminate.

5.3. If the rights granted to You have been terminated, You may not
exercise any of the rights granted to You unless You reinstate Your
rights from a Contributor with the explicit permission of that
Contributor.

## 6. Disclaimer of Warranty

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
without warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or statutory,
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software
is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or
non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered Software prove
defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost
of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer
of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of
any Covered Software is authorized under this License except under
this disclaimer.

## 7. Limitation of Liability

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Covered Software (including but not limited to damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
all other commercial damages or losses), even if such party shall have
been informed of the possibility of such damages.

## 8. Litigation

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
courts of a jurisdiction defined in a clause identifed in Exhibit A;
the court specified in that clause shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over such litigation.

## 9. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
shall not apply to this License. You may receive a copy of this License
